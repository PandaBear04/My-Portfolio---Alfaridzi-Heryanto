    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Database Administrator Intern at PT Inti Rekrut Indonesia: As part of the team at a headhunting company focused on talent sourcing across various industries, I contributed to the development of internal databases to enhance the candidate search process. My responsibilities included designing and implementing systems that improved the efficiency of identifying and selecting candidates. I also supported the recruitment process by helping identify and recommend suitable candidates for client requests, ensuring a smooth and effective hiring experience.</li>
      <li>Public Relations Lead at Wushu UI: I served as the person in charge of public relations for the University of Indonesia’s Wushu Club, where I managed social media accounts, created promotional content, designed posts, and edited videos to boost the club’s visibility. In November 2024, I led the Public Relations Division for Wugames, a national-level wushu competition held annually by the club. That same year, I was also part of the organizing committee for the Indonesia National Junior Wushu Championship, hosted by the Ministry of Youth and Sports — the biggest event I’ve been involved in during my time as a student.
In addition to my organizational role, I am also a Wushu Sanda (Chinese Kickboxing) athlete and have represented the club in several competitions.</li>
